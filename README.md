# JobClub Description
Welcome to the React Job Board project! This is a job board web application built using React that allows users to browse available jobs, view job details, apply for jobs, and track their job applications.

Features
-Job List: On the main page, users can see a list of available jobs. Each job listing includes key details such as the job title, company, location, and a brief description.

-Job Detail Page: Clicking on a job listing from the main page takes the user to a detailed job description page. Here, users can find comprehensive information about the job, including requirements and other relevant details.

-Apply for Job: Users can easily apply for a job by using the provided application form on the job detail page. The form allows users to enter their name, contact information, and upload their resume.

-Application Status: The application status feature helps users keep track of the jobs they have applied for. Users can access a dashboard or a separate page that displays a list of all their job applications.

-Navigation: The application utilizes React Router to enable smooth navigation between different pages, making it convenient for users to switch between the job list, job detail page, and application status page.
-Responsiveness: Ensure your project is mobile-friendly, as many users might access your job board from their smartphones or tablets.
